# Keycloak Auth Service

We will be using a dockerized version of keycloak attached to a postgres database.

## Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file and include the custom data explained in `.env.example` file
2. Run `docker-compose up` (or `make start`)
3. You should see your keycloak server running in the localhost:8080 (or the port you set)
